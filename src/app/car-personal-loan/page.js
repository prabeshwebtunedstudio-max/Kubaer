        </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Secured Car Loans:</strong> The car itself acts as security for the loan. Lower interest rates, ideal for new or relatively new vehicles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unsecured Personal Loans (for Cars):</strong> No security needed, more flexible but higher interest rates. Suitable for older cars or unique circumstances.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dealer Finance vs. Broker Sourced Loans:</strong> We compare multiple lenders to secure the best rate and terms, often saving you money.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Balloon Payments:</strong> Some loans allow a "balloon payment" at the end of the term, reducing regular repayments.
